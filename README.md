**K Nearest Neighbor**

    Data - [KNN_Project_Data]

        classified data set from a company, with hidden feature column names.
        Used KNN to create a model that directly predicts a class for a new data point based on features.

        - Since Scale of variables mattes, Standardized variables.
        - Determined Optimal number of clusters (K) using Elbow method
        - KNN model
        - Evaluated model with Classification Report and Confusion matrix

    Data - [KNN_Project_Data csv]

        Repeated the process above on a different Data Set.
